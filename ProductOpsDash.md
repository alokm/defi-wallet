			- Segment.com or
			- Heap.io 
	- User Analytics (Insight):
		- Amplitude,
		- Google BigQuery and Mode Analytics,
		- Snowflake w/ any BI tool like Tableau or Power BI

- *Onboarding* - from signup to first transaction
	- How long does it take for a new user to go from signup to first deposit?
	- How many steps?
	- How many sessions?
	- How many days?
	- How many support tickets?
	- How many users tried and tried but then gave up and failed silently (say after 30 days of inaction)?
- *Usage* - how does the user behave in-app?
	- what features or pages are most used by frequency, sessions, total session time, session time per week etc
	- Core Feature Area usage - Depth of Usage
		- Feature Area A - Wallet home
		- Feature Area B - Atomic Swap
		- Feature Area C - Multi-chain usage
		- ..
- *Action* - what specific actions does the user take in-app?
	- Amplitude and FullStory help us understand actions completed and attempted as well as multi-device user journeys to identify bottlenecks and priorities high-traffic routes.
	- Requires investigation - out of scope for now
- *Satisfaction* - how happy are users?
	- One question in-app survey to a random subset of users on a weekly basis. Work with Marketing and Leadership to choose the question but model on CSAT or NPS - stick with it over time. Use a 7 point scale or higher resolution.
	- [Optional] Second question. Open-ended. “How can we make it better?”
		- Apply some ML on this feedback to do clustering and feature request management from this treasure trove of data. There are lots of 3rd party tools that do this. I’m no expert but I believe Intercom does this well.
