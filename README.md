defi-wallet is building a wallet that offers users access to a new fully decentralized world. This idea of sovereign control over oneâ€™s money and all the benefits and responsibilities that go with it - is a powerful one, but today it is still mostly a vision for most users, not a reality. 
The biggest problem facing defi-wallet is, how can we build a product for a market that largely doesn't exist today, but one we want to bring into focus so we can be ready for the users when they do come?
