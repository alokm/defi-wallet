* defi-wallet is building a multi-chain non-custodial crypto wallet that offers users access to a fully decentralized universe. 

* Decentralization is a spectrum and I estimate that many, if not most, crypto enthusiasts today do not hold the majority of their crypto assets in wallets where they alone hold the keys. 

* Most users start their journey through a centralized fiat gateway via an exchange. 

* Before users can adopt a defi-wallet they must first understand the meaning of the statement: "Not your keys, not your coins." 

* This idea of sovereign control over oneâ€™s money and all the benefits and responsibilities that go with it - is a powerful one, but today it is still mostly a vision for most users, not a reality. 

* The biggest problem facing defi-wallet is, how can we build a product for a market that largely doesn't exist today, but one we want to bring into focus so we can be ready for the users when they do come?
