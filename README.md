# Liquality Product Proposal
Liquality is building a wallet that offers users access to a new fully decentralized world. This idea of sovereign control over one’s money and all the benefits and responsibilities that go with it, is a powerful one but today it is mostly a vision for most, not a reality. 

*Question*Who uses non-custodial cross-chain cryptocurrency wallets today?
*Answer*
- cypherpunks - Satoshi and friends
- crypto-natives - Satoshi’s disciples
- hard-core deFiers - Vitalik’s disciples
- whales (OG Bitcoin or Ethereum hodlers)
- no one else (yet)

*Question:* How do you grow the Liquality user base by 100x?
*Answer:* 
* By understanding that the next million users don’t even know they need your product today. They may not even understand what a cryptocurrency wallet does or what the difference is between chains and layer-2 solutions. 
* This is a very early emerging market and the answer for growth cannot be to acquire more users as they discover the need for Liquality. 
* Instead the answer must be to educate the broader cryptocurrency community on the benefits of decentralized finance over centralized finance, because growing their understanding of DeFi positions Liquality as the obvious gateway product.
* See *What is DeFi* for an example strategy to drive 100x growth via Product Marketing and great technical writing to educate the 100x users on DeFi.

*Question:* How would you differentiate Liquality from competitors. What more can we do to stand out in the market?
*Answer* We need to double down on the most important feature for users in a DeFi world: Impeccable security, trust, and safety of their crypto assets.
* See *Save your seed* for an example strategy to drive 1000x improvement in user sentiment in Liquality as the most trusted name in non-custodial wallet multi-chain wallets.
