# Questions to answer:

## 1. What are the most important factors to consider when making the switch between product to platform? 

The most important factors to consider when switching from product to platform are around how the incentives should changes to ensure that the platform drives the right incentives for the relevant stakeholders. In the case of defi-wallet, moving to a platform requires that the incentives and the go-to-market strategy are designed to ensure that *developer partners* are highly motivated to invest in defi-wallet and to continue to engage over time. By ensuring that *developer partners* are invested in the success of defi-wallet, we can ensure that the transition from product to platform is more likely to be a success.

The difference between a product and a platform is like the difference between a store and a shopping mall. As defi-wallet transitions to a platform, the key success factors change. No longer is it good enough to have a nice customer-facing app with good UX and powerful utility, now interoperability and support for <insert my favorite protocol> are what really matters to users. 
  
In a heterogeneous multi-chain platform, it matters: 
  
1. What popular protocols are supported?
2. How deep is the integration? Is it just atomic swaps or does it go deeper?
3. What is the platform's approach to showcasing and aiding in discovery and adoption of new protocols?
  
For a strategy that answers this question of which factors to consider when switching from product to platform, consider the factors defined above as well as this key takaway: 
  
**More and deeper integrations with the emerging DeFi community of protocols, combined with a unified discovery and onboarding user experience for defi-wallet are the best way to ensure success as you transition to a platform.**
  
See [What is DeFi](https://github.com/alokm/defi-wallet/blob/main/user-facing.md#3-what-is-defi) for an example strategy to get started.

## 2. How would you prioritize the different Liquality users when thinking about who will be most critical to the success of the project, and what actions would you take to prioritize them? 
a. Wallet end users
b. Liquidity providers (who act as the counterparty to cross-chain swaps) 
c. Developers - building integrations inside the Wallet 
d. Dapps - who integrate cross-chain atomic swaps into their platform e. Other community members - who help grow and govern the DAO 

**The answer is c c c (Developers! Developers! Developers!) 
Developers are the most important user persona in ensuring the success of the defi-wallet ecosystem.**

To win in this early and fast-evolving market, the answer is to prioritize the needs of developer partners over the needs of all other user personas in the short-term. While it is always nice to have a better user experience for wallet end users, the more capable platform is the more likely to win in the long-term. To have the more capable platform, defi-wallet needs to position itself as the most compelling wallet integration option for the diverse developer partner community. **Win the developer community, and all other user personas will be easier wins.**

## 3. What are some of the critical user experience and product changes that we would need to change in the current product to allow it to become an open platform? Feel free to present any mock ups or annotated drawings of current product 

## 4. What are the key metrics you would capture to track the projectâ€™s success, and which tools would you use to capture them (inside the wallet extension and mobile)? 

## 5. What are some of the most important integrations you would prioritize into the Wallet? 

## 6. Bonus: how would you prevent malicious integrations from being accepted into the Wallet?
